#Exercise 1: Look at the following code
#Ask for the third fruit from the user

fr1 = "apples"
fr2 = "bananas"
fr3 = ("Write down any fruit:\n")    #Hint: What function do I use to ask the user for information? 

#We want to show all the fruits we have
#Complete the code:

print()
print()
print()

#Now, let's tell the user what fruit do you like the most
#using the variables

print("My favorite fruit is: ")

#Now, the following code is 3 variables with the amount
#of each fruit that we have. Ask for the third number instead.

n1 = 4
n2 = 3
n3 = ("How many %ss do I have?\n")

#Print the total amount of fruits that we have using
#the variables and string formatting

print("I have %d %s, %d %s and %d %ss" )
total = 
print("I have %s fruits in total." )
